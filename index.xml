      <description>Eureka An old Fashion Equation Solver During my studies (several years ago), I discovered the Equation solver TkSolver. Some days ago, I was trying to find a GNU equivalent to TkSolver as I wanted to perform some computations. My searches were unsuccessful (not exactly but I didn’t find a similar tool) but I found Eureka Solver which is an old solver (may be the first of this type).
Eureka Solver (and TK solver) is build on the declarative programming approach while the « standard » solvers use a procedural approach.</description>
