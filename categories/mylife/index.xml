      <description>Transition to static webserver My blog does not require so much controls. PHP, SQL database,&amp;hellip; are useless for my needs. So, I switch to a static website. I initially used HubPress to power my website. It was great, but the development seems to be stopped. I try another approach with Hugo.
Here, I need to build my pages (well Netlify does it automatically for me) while previously PHP builds my pages at each calls (not exactly, this is why there is some temporary storage).</description>
